# Project 3, Logs Analysis Project


To start, make sure that you set the initial configuration of the queries.py file to point to your database, with the correct username and password, otherwise a connection error will occur. 

Then, run: 

```sh
pip -r | requirements.txt
python queries.py
```

This uses Python 2.7.13, located in the `.python-version`.
